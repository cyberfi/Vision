# Cyber Foundation - Infrastructural DeFi Visionaries

Introducing CYFI, the first ever Financial Solution Infrastructure for the Polkadot and Ethereum blockchain.
CyberFinance is an initiative initiated by a to date anonymous collective called Cyber Foundation, with the aim to collectively disturb the world of traditional finance. By the use of Smart Contracts on both the Polkadot and Ethereum Blockchain. CYFI guarantees non-temperable contractual transfers & interest yielding financial products to give the population back the power over their own funds, we certainly believe in our mission and it's importance, do you?
Ok. So keep reading.

CYFI is the first Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) to bring full transparency to the world of Finance and beyond. The CYFI Token serves as the governance token for the CyberFinance infrastructure (See below), it gains its value by the usage and constant demand algorithmic design, CYFI is deflationary and will burn 1% of a transaction's value with a max of 50 burned tokens per transaction. Unlike many other projects in this space, CYFI has real utility in every day life from the array of products in the infrastructure, CYFI token will be used for all aspects of the infrastructure. CYFI token is advantageous and recommended when using any piece of Cyber Finance infrastructure.

CYFI will first be launched as an ERC20 token and will later be interconnected to the Polkadot chain Blockchain through the Moonbeam protocol, by using Moonbeam.network, CyberFinance is not restricted to current technologies and give us flexibility between multiple blockchains going into the future, Moonbeam is based on Substrate and gives CYFI the full power to work on future proof protocols for finance.

# Cyber Finance Infrastructure
- Cyber Yield Farming™ (eta. September 2020)
- Cyber Vaults™ (eta. October 2020)
- Cyber Swap™ (eta. October 2020)
- Cyber Lending™ (eta. November 2020)
- Cyber Deriviates™ (early Q1 2021)
- Cyber Marketplace™ (Q1 2021)
- Cyber Banking™ (Q2 2021)

All estimated timeframes are taken conservatively, as the Decentralised Finance space is currently experiencing explosive growth (in development) it may mean that some solutions will be available earlier than expected.
With the completion of these essential services Cyber will bring the first ever vision of a financially decentralised infrastructure to fruition, users will be able to enjoy the ease of working with a fully decentralised package and could effectively replace it with the services they currently use financially. In the design of Cyber our users will be able to collectively decide what features and or solutions will be built and released to meet demand of the quickly moving space.

# Tokenomics
There will never be more than 700,000 CYFI tokens in circulation, 1% of every transaction gets burned, with a max of 50 CYFI burnt per transaction.
The distribution is as follows :

- 70,000 CYFI | Team Tokens
* 10% Of CYFI supply will be distributed to the team over the period of one year, tokens are used for development and marketing costs.

- 70,000 CYFI | Vault Rewards
* The Vault rewards are distributed over the period of one year, this means that it will take 365 days for the full amount of tokens to be distributed.

- 210,000 CYFI | Yield Farming Rewards
* 30% Of CYFI supply is dedicated to be rewards claimed from farming, We dedicate this % to promote equal distribution and kickstart the protocol.

- 350,000 CYFI | Seed Sale
* For the most fair form of distribution we use a seed sale with a limited cap per wallet for Fair distribution of CYFI. 50% is dedicated to the sale, more info on this sale will follow soon. 50% of funds raised will be put towards liquidity, 50% preserved for Development of infrastructure.

- Seed Sale Details :
* Rate : 1 ETH = 500 CYFI
* Cap : 10 ETH Address Limit.
* If any tokens are unsold the unsold tokens will be distributed to buyers according to purchase size.
* Sale Announcement Coming Soon, look out for socials.

# Cyber Yield Farming
Yield farming is the hottest thing in Decentralised Finance right now, but it is not accessible to everyone. In this time of extreme hype, big players are taking advantage of the smaller decentralised finance pioneers and use their size advantage to transfer wealth into their own pockets by participating in shady pump and dump schemes and other manipulations. Unfortunately this often leaves the investor without the deep technical and or financial knowledge at a sharp disadvantage.
Cyber launches a fair and equitable way to participate in yield farming, so that everyone is on the same level playing field, regardless of their financial resources and technical knowledge. The financial protection and security is encoded into all the smart contracts used in our financial wealth management solutions. It ensures that the only way fees can be modified is by lowering them. This way, investors are safe in the knowledge that no governance, even if it came under the control of malicious actors, would be unable to introduce higher fees.
In Cyber Finance vaults, sophisticated investors can monitor the level of idle funds and avoid paying withdrawal fees, while the common investor gets hit by a 0.5% withdrawal fee (e.g. YFI, other Yield Farming initiatives). In contrast, CYFI vaults has a 0.15% fee which is applied on all vaults, all tokens collected from fees are either used for automatic algorithmic buybacks or CYFI token burning. Even though we are the head of the pack in terms of protecting investors, all projects must adapt to the ever changing industry.
Cyber Finance does this through a community-governed DAO that, we trust, will see to it that we keep our strong commitments to investors while building value for the entire ecosystem. We focus on governance through securely signed off and on chain voting to ensure that voting is agile, and inexpensive. This way, it is feasible to have guiding votes on even minor features of the protocol, in contrast to certain situations where the core team makes infrequent take it or leave it type proposals, giving voters little real chance to influence the protocol's development.
To protect the long term value of the CYFI token, there is a token burn process that will gradually reduce the number of CYFI tokens in existence while not actually bringing discomfort to the users of the platform.

# Cyber Vaults
Vaults offer a way for investors to participate in yield farming in a simple, yet cost-effective way. Yield farming generally involves providing liquidity and receiving reward tokens in return, sometimes of many different types. The vaults automatically sell any received tokens and recycle the proceeds to add more liquidity, generating compounding income for investors and freeing them from doing this work themselves, often at a prohibitive gas cost.
Vaults range from low risk strategies where the funds are withdrawable at any moment to ones with higher risk and potentially higher rewards, which may require funds to be locked up for a period of time. Please see the risk disclosure of each vault before making investment decisions.
Vault fees are divided between the token burn function (0.15% of Tx value), and the strategist developer (If community made, strategists get 0.05% of Tx value) In the interest of democratizing yield farming, we invite community members to submit their own strategies. Strategies approved by the DAO (following a technical review) will be deployed to vaults and the fees shared with the creator(s).

# About Cyber Foundation
Cyber Foundation was started as a group of likeminded developers with a combined experience of over thirty years as Financial Sector Software Developers and is starting to build into an action team for financial freedom world wide, our action came upon seeing the world of Decentralised Finance being overrun by money-motivated mediocre developers along with frustration with the world of traditional finance which is being ruled by greed and unethical practices. Cyber Foundation is born to compete with regular finance protocols and bridges the gap of usability for decentralised and traditional financial systems. We at Cyber connect existing technologies with Cyber™ Products as well as developing our own protocols for the future of Finance. Within our vision it is important that DeFi projects collaborate and work upon each others creations, there is no need to reinvent the wheel, any technology made by us or other DeFi projects should be considered a collective push for financial transparency against a corrupt establishment. We encourage every developer team world wide to work with us on making fair financial products available across the globe, with no sacrifices of Transparency, Security and Stability.

Cyber Foundation in its developments is not limited to Financial Products, our vision is to create a world of equality, fairness and transparency.

Our products are purely motivated by our vision and not by monetary motives, in the future as Cyber's influence grows we strive to deliver Governmental Solutions for countries and societies. Our vision includes the integration of blockchain in almost every aspect of government. A government should not serve itself but its people, Cyber Foundation will be a platform for change and we strive to deliver an entirely working ecosystem for Financial Products to meet the demands of a daily financial experience by Q2 2021, with the start of Yield Mining, interoperable swaps coming as early as the end of September 2020. Fair Governance solutions and protocols will be available as early as Q4 2021, the protocols we are currently planning for are an election protocol, on chain fact checking/ authority and a toolkit to integrate existing technologies with blockchain, think about registries, public information and equal justice. You are the leader of this world as much as anybody else on this globe, you deserve to know and you deserve to choose.

Sincerely,
The Cyber Foundation -
